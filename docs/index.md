## 🤖 AI Capabilities Showcase

### LangGraph Workflow Example
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropic
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Multi-model trading workflow
workflow = StateGraph(TradingState)

# Claude 3.5 for complex reasoning
workflow.add_node("market_analysis", create_claude_analysis_node())

# GPT-4 Turbo for rapid processing  
workflow.add_node("risk_assessment", create_gpt4_risk_node())

# Local Llama for sensitive data
workflow.add_node("compliance_check", create_llama_compliance_node())

trading_workflow = workflow.compile()
```

### Vector Search Integration
```python
from langchain_pinecone import PineconeVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

# Semantic search across trading documents
vector_store = PineconeVectorStore(
    embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-large"),
    index_name="commodity-knowledge"
)

# Find relevant trading precedents
results = vector_store.similarity_search(
    "copper hedging strategies for volatile markets",
    k=5
)
```
