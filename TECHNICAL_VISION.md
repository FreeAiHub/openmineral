## AI Tools and Approaches

### Development with Cursor IDE

Our development approach centers around Cursor IDE, which provides AI-assisted coding capabilities:

- **Code Generation** - Automatically generate boilerplate code, API endpoints, and UI components
- **Refactoring Suggestions** - AI-powered refactoring recommendations to improve code quality
- **Documentation Creation** - Automatic generation of code documentation and comments
- **Bug Detection** - Early identification of potential bugs and security issues

### LLM-Based Copilots

We implement specialized AI copilots for different aspects of trading operations:

- **Deal Intelligence Assistant** - Analyzes deal structures, identifies potential risks, and suggests optimization strategies
- **Compliance Copilot** - Ensures all deals meet regulatory requirements and flags potential compliance issues
- **Market Analysis Agent** - Provides real-time insights on market conditions and price forecasts
- **Workflow Automation Bot** - Guides users through SOPs and automates repetitive tasks

### AI-First Development Methodology

Our development process follows an AI-first approach:

1. **Problem Definition** - Clearly articulate business problems that can be solved with AI
2. **Data Preparation** - Ensure high-quality, well-structured data for AI models
3. **Model Selection** - Choose appropriate AI models for specific use cases
4. **Integration** - Seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into existing workflows
5. **Evaluation** - Continuously measure AI performance and business impact

## Cloud Infrastructure (AWS/Azure)
