# Metal Price Prediction System

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a sophisticated AI-powered system for predicting metal prices using advanced machine learning techniques. The system integrates historical price data, economic indicators, and market sentiment to provide accurate price forecasts for commodity trading.

## Business Problem

Commodity traders need accurate price predictions to:
- Optimize trade timing and execution
- Manage inventory and hedging strategies
- Reduce market exposure risk
- Improve profitability through better decision-making

### Data Sources Integration

1. **London Metal Exchange (LME) Data**
   - Historical price data for copper, aluminum, zinc, lead, nickel
   - Volume and open interest data
   - Forward curve and contango/backwardation analysis

2. **Economic Indicators**
   - US Dollar Index (DXY)
   - Global GDP growth rates
   - Manufacturing PMI indices
   - Interest rates and bond yields

3. **Supply & Demand Fundamentals**
   - Mine production data
   - Inventory levels (LME warehouses, SHFE)
   - Import/export statistics
   - Consumption patterns by industry

4. **Alternative Data Sources**
   - News sentiment analysis (Reuters, Bloomberg)
   - Social media sentiment (Twitter, Reddit)
   - Satellite imagery for mining activity
   - Shipping and logistics data

### Machine Learning Models

#### 1. LSTM Neural Networks
```python
# Example model architecture
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

def create_lstm_model(sequence_length, features):
    model = tf.keras.Sequential([
        LSTM(100, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(sequence_length, features)),
        Dropout(0.2),
        LSTM(100, return_sequences=True),
        Dropout(0.2),
        LSTM(50),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(25),
        Dense(1)
    ])
    
    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mse', metrics=['mae'])
    return model
```

#### 2. Ensemble Methods
- Random Forest for non-linear patterns
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for feature importance
- Support Vector Regression for robust predictions

#### 3. Transformer Models
- Attention mechanisms for long-term dependencies
- Multi-head attention for different market factors
- Position encoding for temporal relationships

    features: dict

class PredictionResponse(BaseModel):
    metal: str
    current_price: float
    predicted_price: float
    confidence_interval: tuple
    probability_up: float

@app.post("/predict", response_model=PredictionResponse)
async def predict_price(request: PredictionRequest):
    # Load pre-trained model
    model = tf.keras.models.load_model(f"models/{request.metal}_lstm.h5")
    
    # Prepare features
    features = prepare_features(request.features, request.horizon_days)
    
    # Make prediction
    prediction = model.predict(features.reshape(1, -1, features.shape[1]))
    
    # Calculate confidence intervals
    confidence_interval = calculate_confidence_interval(prediction, request.metal)
    
    return PredictionResponse(
        metal=request.metal,
        current_price=request.features["current_price"],
        predicted_price=float(prediction[0][0]),
